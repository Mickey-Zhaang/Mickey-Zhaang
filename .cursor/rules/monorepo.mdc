  instructions: |
  - Respect the project architecture:
    - src/: Source code directory
    - components/: Reusable React components
    - assets/: Static assets and resources
    - .storybook/: Storybook configuration
    - public/: Public assets

  - Follow module boundaries:
    - Keep related code together
    - Avoid circular dependencies
    - Use proper import paths
    - Respect the separation of concerns

  - When adding new code:
    - Determine if it belongs in components, utils, or assets
    - Place reusable components in components/ directory
    - Place utility functions in utils/ directory
    - Follow existing patterns for similar functionality

  - When importing:
    - Use relative imports for files in the same directory
    - Use absolute imports for files in different directories
    - Follow the established import patterns
    - Avoid importing from implementation details

- name: 'Source Directory Structure'

  instructions: |
  - Understand the project structure:
    - src/: Source code directory
    - components/: Reusable React components
    - assets/: Static assets and resources
    - .storybook/: Storybook configuration
    - public/: Public assets

  - When working with the project:
    - Keep related code together in appropriate directories
    - Extract reusable components to components/ directory
    - Follow the established patterns
    - Maintain clean separation of concerns

  - For React components:
    - Follow React best practices
    - Use the established component structure
    - Follow the styling patterns with styled-components
    - Use the established state management patterns

- name: 'Project Structure'

  - Understand the project structure:
    - components/: Reusable React components
    - assets/: Static assets and resources
    - styles/: Global styles and themes
    - utils/: Utility functions and helpers
    - types/: TypeScript type definitions

  - When working with the project:
    - Keep code organized and focused
    - Extract reusable components to components/ directory
    - Document public APIs
    - Follow the established patterns

  - For shared components:
    - Make interfaces clear and well-documented
    - Avoid side effects
    - Keep dependencies minimal
    - Write tests for components

  - When adding new components:

    - Keep dependencies up-to-date
    - Avoid duplicate dependencies
    - Use peer dependencies appropriately

  - When adding dependencies:
    - Consider if the dependency is necessary
    - Check for existing alternatives in the codebase
    - Add to package.json
    - Use specific versions
