    instructions: |
      - Use strict TypeScript configuration:
        - Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
        - Use strict null checks
        - Use no implicit any
        - Use no implicit returns
        - Use explicit function return types

      - Type definitions:
        - Use interfaces for object shapes
        - Use type aliases for unions and complex types
        - Use enums for fixed sets of values
        - Use generics for reusable types
        - Create dedicated type files for shared types

      - Type naming conventions:
        - Use PascalCase for interfaces, types, and enums
        - Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose
        - Suffix interfaces for React props with 'Props'
        - Suffix interfaces for React state with 'State'
        - Prefix interfaces for React context with 'Context'

      - Type safety:
        - Avoid using 'any' type
        - Use unknown instead of any when type is uncertain
        - Use type guards to narrow types
        - Use assertion functions for complex type narrowing
        - Use discriminated unions for complex type hierarchies
        - Use readonly for immutable properties
        - Use const assertions for literal types

      - Type organization:
        - Place shared types in dedicated type files
        - Group related types together
        - Export types that are used across modules
        - Keep internal types private
        - Use namespaces sparingly

      - Advanced TypeScript features:
        - Use mapped types for transforming types
        - Use conditional types for type logic
        - Use template literal types for string manipulation
        - Use utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, etc.)
        - Use type inference when appropriate
        - Use type predicates for custom type guards

      - TypeScript with React:
        - Use React.FC sparingly (prefer explicit props interface)
        - Define prop types as interfaces
        - Use children prop type correctly
        - Type event handlers properly
        - Type refs correctly
        - Use proper types for context

      - TypeScript with APIs:
        - Define request and response types
        - Use zod or similar for runtime validation
        - Type async functions properly
        - Handle errors with proper types
        - Use proper types for API clients
