    instructions: |
      - Follow code quality best practices:
        - Write clean, readable code
        - Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
        - Keep functions small and focused
        - Use meaningful variable and function names
        - Add comments for complex logic

      - Use TypeScript effectively:
        - Use strict type checking
        - Avoid using `any` type
        - Create interfaces for complex objects
        - Use generics where appropriate
        - Use type guards for runtime type checking

      - Follow established patterns:
        - Use consistent naming conventions
        - Follow the project's code style
        - Use established design patterns
        - Follow the project's architecture

      - Write maintainable code:
        - Keep cyclomatic complexity low
        - Avoid deep nesting
        - Use early returns
        - Break complex functions into smaller ones
        - Use pure functions where possible

  - name: 'Testing Standards'
    description: 'Guidelines for writing effective tests'
    files: '**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'
    instructions: |
      - Write comprehensive tests:
        - Unit tests for individual functions and components
        - Integration tests for component interactions
        - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
        - Performance tests for critical paths

      - Follow testing best practices:
        - Use descriptive test names
        - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
        - Test edge cases and error conditions
        - Mock external dependencies
        - Use test fixtures for complex data

      - For React component testing:
        - Test component rendering
        - Test user interactions
        - Test state changes
        - Test error handling
        - Test accessibility

      - For API testing:
        - Test happy paths
        - Test error conditions
        - Test validation
        - Test authentication/authorization
        - Test performance

  - name: 'Code Review Standards'
    description: 'Guidelines for effective code reviews'
    files: '**/*'
    instructions: |
      - During code reviews, check for:
        - Adherence to project standards
        - Potential bugs and edge cases
        - Error handling
        - Security issues
        - Performance considerations
        - Code duplication
        - Proper testing

      - For TypeScript code, verify:
        - Type safety
        - Proper use of generics
        - Absence of `any` type
        - Null/undefined handling
        - Proper interface/type definitions
        - Proper use of type guards

      - For React code, check:
        - Component structure
        - Hook dependencies
        - Performance optimizations
        - Accessibility
        - State management
        - Proper cleanup
        - Error boundaries
