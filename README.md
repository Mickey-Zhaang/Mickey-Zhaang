### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Mickey-Zhaang/Mickey-Zhaang** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting situated in College
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on many projects to come within my new career as a college student.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding Github and the Codespace
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm free to talk openly to anyone and willing to listen to anything (I like music).
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Best contact is either through Insta or Whatsapp | insta: @mickey_zhaang 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: (he/him)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I feel like I've already said this alot but I am fond of poetry. ğŸ’™ I especially like to write my own: got into Colby with a creative writing portfolio focused on a collection of poems about someone I adored. Though there were a few missing as not even the College can have poems that were special to me and her.
